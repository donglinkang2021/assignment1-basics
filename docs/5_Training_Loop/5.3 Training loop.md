## 5.3 Training loop

Now, itâ€™s finally time to put all of the components you implemented together into your main training script. It will pay off to make it easy to start training runs with different hyperparameters (e.g., by taking them as command-line arguments), since you will be doing these many times later to study how different choices impact training.

**Problem (training_together): Put it together (4 points)**

**Deliverable:** Write a script that runs a training loop to train your model on user-provided input.

In particular, we recommend that your training script allow for (at least) the following:

*   Ability to configure and control the various model and optimizer hyperparameters.
*   Memory-efficient loading of training and validation large datasets with `np.memmap`.
*   Serializing checkpoints to a user-provided path.
*   Periodically logging training and validation performance (e.g., to console and/or an external service like Weights and Biases).[^a]
